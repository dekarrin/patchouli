		<h1>The Importance of Coding Exercises In Interviews</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">A defense of the practice</p>
		<p class="subtitle">By dekarrin</p>
		<p>
			As a software engineering professional, I sometimes have the task of helping
			to interview new candidates for my company. I have a particular approach I
			like to take for a coding interview that includes a variety of questions;
			additionally, I've found that a simple coding exercise is a great tool for
			determining a candidate's eligibility, and I always include one as part of my
			interviews. I find it so useful that I often advocate for its use in all
			interviews for hiring developers.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've run into a little bit of flak for this. Recently, I had a discussion with
			<a href="https://jghibiki.github.io">Jordan Goetze</a> regarding this topic.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this essay, I will attempt to address these concerns and show why I believe
			that a coding exercise should be presented to every potential hire, as well as
			show some additional information on what types of questions are suitable for
			use as coding exercises.

		<h2 id="harmful">Exercises Considered Harmful?</h2>
		<p>
			As I often do, I was chatting with Jordan on one of our shared community
			servers. One thing lead to another, and the topic of coding questions in
			interviews was brought up, and Jordan noted some concerns that he had.
		<p>
		<p>
			He mentioned that the abstraction of the process can be very intimidating
			for some, and that simple logic problems don't really provide insight on
			someone's ability to work on large scale systems such as full web apps or
			business logic on backend servers. In particular, he raised concerns that a
			coding exercise is only really useful for checking if a person can think on
			their feet under pressure, which is not normal working conditions for most
			developers.
		</p>
		<p>
			I absolutely agree that these are some valid concerns, but I don't think that
			they should stop the coding exercise from being used. I do believe that it
			should be used with care, and that the decision to move forward shouldn't be
			a simple yes or no based entirely around whether the candidate excels at
			solving the exercise, but I believe that leaving it out entirely removes a
			valuable evaluation tool from the interviewer's toolbelt.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, if a candidate needs to take time and think during a coding exercise,
			that's totally fine! I really don't care; hell, I don't even care if they're
			able to finish the problem or not, as long as they can at least demonstrate
			skills towards solving a problem and expose their thought process a little
			bit, whether it be by talking about it heavily or demonstrating it through
			the way they work through the problem.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, it's true that being able to solve a simple coding exercise
			does not tell whether someone can code a backbend server; if there were such
			a test that were simple and could be done within an interview, I'd gladly
			use that. So far, I haven't seen anything like that. But the goal of the
			simple coding problem exercise is not to screen out all but the very best
			coders; instead, it's to screen out the ones that have zero coding ability at
			all; that is, those who the company would have to expend resources on in order
			to bring them up to basic functional competency.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, I heartily agree when it comes to the large and open-ended
			problems (such as "design and code an enterprise payroll system that works
			within our allotted time"), or the lateral-thinking logic puzzle questions; I
			don't believe that they prove anything and I further believe that they are a
			waste of time. I'd maybe give some credence to a "design a large system"
			question, as long as it doesn't have to implemented. But if the candidate is
			not yet capable of coming up with an algorithm for, say, testing a palindrome
			given the definition of a palindrome and the fact that the input is a sting,
			that could well point to a lack of functional competency, particularly if
			they are unable to demonstrate any progress towards the answer at all.
			Real-world problems are rarely as perfectly defined as the ones given in these
			exercises, and while there are exceptions, they are typically not not going
			to be any easier.
		</p>
		</p>
			I'm completely aware that a candidate may struggle in a coding test during an
			interview when he otherwise wouldn't. I believe that it's just not a good
			idea to make a hiring decision based solely on a coding exercise; personally I
			factor a candidate's past work and projects highly. I once had a candidate who
			really, really struggled with the exercise portion of an interview. He was
			able to just barely squeak by with a lot of prompting, and it was clear that
			he was intimidated by it. But the fact that he had multiple personal projects
			as well as past work, as well as the way he spoke about past projects told me
			that he would be a strong coder in the long term with a passion and a
			<i>desire</i> to become more and more skilled. That combined with his answers
			to the social-skills portion of the interview to make him a good candidate in
			my eyes, and made me believe that he was plenty competent in coding, and
			likely struggled in the exercise due to the high-pressure environment. I gave
			a thumbs-up on hiring.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, if that's the case and I ignored the fact that he struggled on the
			exercise, then why do I even have an exercise at all? Well, interviewing is a
			tricky task. I consider all portions of the interview together when making my
			final decision, and as I previously alluded to, I have questions related to
			social skills and conflict resolution, a coding exercise, and an analysis of
			past projects as well as the candidate's feelings on them. I also tend to
			include some language knowledge questions, but I find that these only tend to
			inform me as to the candidate's ability to memorize coding trivia, and I
			don't give much weight to them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Can this method be exploited by a fast-talking social master? Absolutely! Will
			there be some candidates who would otherwise be great employees who get
			screened out due to this method? You bet! It isn't perfect, and I certainly
			don't think that I've mastered interviewing, or even come close to the best
			solution. But in my limited experience, I've found that this multi-pronged
			approach is far better than leaving the interview at simple "Name a time you
			had a problem with a collaborator, and how did you resolve it?"-style
			questions.
		</p>
		<p>
			When it comes down to it, FizzBuzz-style questions are an important part of
			the interview process, and leaving them out will overall hurt the final
			interview process.
		</p>
		<h2 href="adapting">Adapting for Problem-Solving Styles</h2>
		<p>
			Jordan went on to say:
		</p>
		<p class="quote">
			I guess my problem is less with coding samples, and more with how they are
			framed. FizzBuzz comes off as oblique to me because of the naming conventions
			used, for visual people it makes it difficult to visualize. Now as you
			suggested, the palindrome example is a little less oblique (assuming you know
			what a palindrome is) because you can visualize a word in your head by
			writing it down and working out a method step by step before coding it (and I
			think the problem solving is the more important part anyways). I would prefer
			it if coding problems were made more visual.
		</p>
		<p>
			That made a lot of sense to me, and really made me think about what styles of
			questions are suitable for a candidate. It would be unfortunate if a candidate
			bombs an exercise when they they would have done perfectly had the style of
			the question been different, and it could unintentionally cause a company to
			favor talent that is good at a particular style of problem solving. I firmly
			believe that the best collaborative environment can only be made by bringing
			together skilled people who have a variety of different techniques for
			approaching problems, and locking out potential hires because they don't
			confirm to my favored method of problem solving is the last thing I want.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jordan went on to give an example of the type of problem he would prefer:
		</p>
		<p class="quote">
			"If you have 2 sheep in a pen and every minute they double, each sheep takes 1
			meter of space and the pen is rectangular and 64 meters x 71 meters long.
			Write a program that calculates when the pen will be overflowing"<br /><br />
			While yes, this is a simple math problem, one of the required skills is
			analyzing the problem. e.g. "we want to know when the pen overflows <b>not</b>
			when it is full" and that "the number of sheep doubles each minute." Then from
			there, determining how to translate this relatively simple word problem to a
			math problem, then from a math problem how to approach it programmatically.
		</p>
		<p>
			I brought up that perhaps a compromise could be reached by presenting a
			candidate with a selection of different problems, each of which are better
			suited to a slightly different kind of approach. The candidate could then
			choose which one he prefers to work on. Jordan was on board with that, but
			warned that <span class="quote">"they should all be relatively the same
			difficulty; otherwise someone might pick a problem with nicer wording but
			that has a lot of hidden complexity,"</span> which I completely agree with.
		</p>
		<h2 href="criteria">Making a Good Exercise</h2>
		<p>
			It's tough to come up with a good coding exercise. How do you construct a
			question that really demonstrates the core competencies necessary in
			superstar developers?
		</p>
		<p>
			To answer this question, I ask myself what an engineer does during the course
			of his work. Generally, we have to take existing issues and problems
			statements, come up with an algorithm that solves the issue while following
			the constraints, and possibly change the algorithm as additional constraints
			are added or removed from the problem.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of course, the question being delivered in an interview itself has the
			additional constraint of it being possible to solve relatively quickly. This
			can be avoided by sending the exercise with the candidate to complete on their
			time, but I'm just not sure that this would give as much insight to the their
			thought process.
		</p>
		<p>
			With all this in mind, I decided that coding questions should demonstrate the
			following attributes:
			<ul>
				<li>Demonstrates use of flow control.</li>
				<li>Can have additional constraints placed on it to possibly give the coder a chance to modify their solution.</li>
				<li>Can be solved in around 15 minutes or less.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Questions such as FizzBuzz, palindrome detection, and exponential sheep growth
			fit this model very well, and are what I would consider to be ideal exercise
			questions.
		</p>
		<p>
			No matter how the questions are selected, having a candidate go through the
			exercise demonstrates how they attempt to solve the problem, providing
			valuable insight into their qualification. FizzBuzz and its ilk are a strong
			component for determining eligibility, and are a necessary part of any
			interview process.
