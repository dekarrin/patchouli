		<h1>Metrics for H@H Client</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">A tutorial for monitoring your client using Telegraf and Grafana</p>
		<p class="subtitle">By dekarrin</p>
		<p>
			This tutorial is a step-by-step process for the setup of a system for monitoring the
			Hentai@Home client using graphs and automated alerts. It uses the Grafana web
			application to show charts of the client’s performance and hath generation, Telegraf to
			both collect information from the host machines of the H@H clients as well as to collect
			information on the Hath network performance from the main Hentai@Home website, and
			InfluxDB as the metric storage backend. DigitalOcean is used to host these services on a
			server separate from the H@H clients in order to provide constant monitoring even during
			client downtime.

		</div>
		<p>
			This tutorial is split into several sections. I recommend going through each section in
			order; it might be possible to do the sections out of order, but it could result in
			parts of the metrics pipeline being unstable until the rest of the sections are
			completed.

		<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
		<p>
			There are a few things that you will need in order to set up the metrics stack. You are
			of course free to substitute the requirements as you see fit, but this is the system
			that works for me. If you do end up finding different ways to do things, please let me
			know and I would be happy to include it in this document.
		</p>
		<p>Here is what you will need (all prices given are in United States Dollar):
		<ul>
			<li><b>At least one Hentai@Home client that is already running and is actively
				contributing to the hath network.</b> This guide will not be very helpful if you
				don’t already have a running client; go to
				<a href="https://e-hentai.org/hentaiathome.php">the H@H info page</a> for info on
				running a client. Actually setting up the client is beyond the scope of this guide;
				please refer to the link and/or contact Tenboro on the forums for help with the
				actual set up and administration of the client.
			</li>
			<li><b>At least one web-accessible server that you have full root access on, or about
				$5/month to buy one from DigitalOcean, preferably completely separate from the
				Hentai@Home host machine.</b> This box will be used to host the data storage backend
				InfluxDB as well as the chart and graph front-end, Grafana. It will also be used to
				collect metrics on your client from the Hentai@Home client info page using Telegraf.
				If you wish to separate these functionalities into separate servers, by all means
				please do. I recommend against putting these services on any boxes that are also
				hosting the H@H client; again <span class="warning">this must be separate from the
				H@H client machine, or you will not be able to see metrics or get alerts when that
				client goes down.</span> I also do not recommend self-hosting this box at home; it’s
				only $5/month for a micro instance from DigitalOcean and only a little bit more for
				instances on other IaaS, and that gets you the assurance that your monitoring is
				always up without you having to deal with the headache of infrastructure management
				and maintenance.
			</li>
			<li><b>A domain name, or about $10 to $30 per year to buy one (price depends on the
				TLD/ending).</b> It will make your life far easier, especially when setting up
				proper HTTPS certificates for your Grafana application. My typical strategy is to
				buy a single domain name and use subdomains to point to different services on
				different servers. If you don’t yet have a domain name, you can buy one from
				<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>, and usually the first year is
				available at a much-reduced rate.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="creating-the-server">Creating the Metrics Server</h2>
		<p>
			You will need a place for Grafana, InfluxDB, and the hath network metrics collection
			daemon to live. I recommend that this be separate from any box that is hosting a H@H
			client, because if it isn’t and that box goes down, you will get zero notifications that
			your client went down. For the same reason, it’s a good idea to have it hosted on a
			different network than the one that your H@H clients are on.
		</p>
		<p>
			You will need a server that is connected to the internet and that you have full root
			access on. Additionally, you will probably want a server with reliable uptime. You do
			not need a very beefy machine; I’ve found that a box with 512MB of RAM and 20GB of disk
			space is perfectly sufficient for my current needs.
		</p>
		<p>
			The quick and easy ways to get a server with good uptime that you don’t have to worry
			about maintaining yourself are to get an instance on an Infrastructure-as-a-Service
			system or to get a VPS. VPSs tend to be a little on the slower side at smaller scale,
			do not often offer easy scaling options (not that this is a concern here), but most
			importantly do not usually give you full root access to the machine; for those reasons,
			I recommend getting a VM instance.
